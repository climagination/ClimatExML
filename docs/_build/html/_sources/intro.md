# ClimatExML Documentation

This documentation describes the software and training process of a statistical downscaling pipeline for climate data. It implements Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) following {cite}`annau2023`. The software is designed and optimized to use convection-permitting models as a high-resolution target, conditional on low-resolution inputs. The software trains Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict high-resolution multivariate fire-weather variables for precipitation, humidity, surface temperature, and wind components.

This project is supported by the ClimatEx project.
